# Newton-s-fractal-project
A nuemeric method to estimate fractal dimensions of Newton's fractals

This project is the final project of my 11th grade CS class.
It is a live MATLAB code, that you can play with to learn about Newton's method and Newton's fractal.
I optimized the original Newton's method using standard techniques, that included: introducing an itteration cap and a tolerance for the converging root.
